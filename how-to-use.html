<div><p style="color: white;">All sub-menus will constantly be updating with realtime data with the exceptions of the final few layers of encoding.</div>
<div><p style="color: white;">These sub-menus cannot be written in, and can only be used for seeing current data readouts.</div>
<div><p style="color: white;"></div>
<div><p style="color: white;">The right-most sub menu contains the merged data used for the strings, x then y.</div>
<div><p style="color: white;"></div>
<div><p style="color: white;">They are encoded using base36-18-36, then hexadecimal encoding, then base64 encoding. It's all stationary encoding that can be decoded at any time.</div>
<div><p style="color: white;">The security comes from the nature of the data's randomness, with no pseudorandomness generated by the computer, only from human input (a famously random source of data).</div>
<div><p style="color: white;"></div>
<div><p style="color: white;"> is suggested that you don't copy the first data points as they could be considered easier to detect.</div>
<div><p style="color: white;">Position updates with IDS are random, with no real purpose to it other than showing detection and javascript script completion. </div>
<div><p style="color: white;"></div>
<div><p style="color: white;">The right column has one extra layer of security, but it makes it so that the left is a completely different data set.</div>
